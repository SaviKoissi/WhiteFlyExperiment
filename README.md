# WhiteFlyExperiment
The experiment aimed to investigate the relationship between cassava variety, whitefly attraction, and Cassava Mosaic Disease (CMD) dynamics. Specifically, it sought to:  1.  Determine if distinct Ivorian cassava varieties differentially attract whiteflies.  2. Investigate the correlation between whitefly repellence and CMD resistance.
